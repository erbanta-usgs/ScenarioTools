Introduction

  Purpose and Scope
  
  Installation
    
  Conventions [used in this report]
  
  Input Data
  
    Shapefiles
      [Polygon]
      [Polyline]
    
    Time-Series Data
      [piecewise and stepwise interpretation, provide figure]
    
    Groups
      [maybe rename these as "zones"]
      [used only by Scenario Analyzer]
      [could implement two ways to generate one: 
        (1) from a Modflow zone array;
        (2) from a polygon shapefile and the model-grid shapefile.]
    
    Georeferenced Image
 
    Initialization File
      [Scenario Manager saves default modflow executable]
  
  Common Files
    [Model Grid]
    [Background Image]
  
Scenario Manager
  [guidance from model provider]

  Scenario Manager Overview
  
    Scenarios, Packages, and Feature Sets
    
    Supported Packages
      [identify and document each supported package]
      [note that support could be added for other packages]
      [for each: what is shapefile used for, what does smp file control?]
      [what constitutes a feature, how is a feature simulated?]
      [logic that defines simulation features derived from shapefile]
      
      Well Package
      
      River Package
      
        [river-segment and river-cell properties]
      
      GHB Package
      
        [leakance]
      
      CHD Package
      
      Recharge Package
  
  Running Scenario Manager
  
    Settings
      [MODFLOW executable]
      [Master MODFLOW name file]
      [Simultaneous scenario runs]
      [Background image file]
      [Model grid shapefile]
      [Simulation start time]
  
    Building Scenarios

Scenario Analyzer  
  
  Scenario Analyzer Overview
  
    Maps, Charts, and Tables
      [each is a type of element]
    
    Data Series Types    
      [list and detail all types; source of data for each type]
      [table showing data-series types that can be used for each element type]
      
    No-data values
      [defaults for HNOFLO, HDRY, CINACT]
  
  Running Scenario Analyzer
