<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr valign="top"><td align="left">
<p>A time-series data file (or "time-series file") contains one or more chronological series time-varying values, where each record in the file is identified by a text string and all records for a given series share the same identifier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The format for text files containing time-series data is based on the specification of a “Bore Sample File” as described by Doherty (2011). By default, names of time-series files are assumed to have “smp” as the file extension. The format as supported in Scenario Manager and Scenario Analyzer is summarized here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each record of a time-series file contains at least four entries separated by one or more spaces in the following order: (1) identifier, (2) date, (3) time, and (4) value. The tab character can also be used as a delimiter. Commas cannot be used as delimiters. An optional fifth entry (indicating the record lacks integrity) may be included as described by <a href="references.htm#dohertyjohn2011">Doherty (2011)</a>, but it is not used by Scenario Manager or Scenario Analyzer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identifier is a string of characters associating the record with a particular site or feature. Unlike the Doherty (2011) specification, the length of the identifier is not limited. The string may not include embedded spaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Date is an 8- to 10-character string in the format MM/DD/YYYY, where MM consists of one or two characters indicating the month, DD is one or two characters indicating the day number in the month, and YYYY is four characters indicating the year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Time is a 5- to 8-character string in the format HH:MM:SS, where HH is one or two characters indicating the hour (0 to 24), MM is one or two characters indicating the minute, and SS is one or two characters indicating the second. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value is a numeric value in floating-point notation. An exponent can be provided using “E” notation. For example 0.0123 can be specified as 1.23E-2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A time-series file can contain records for multiple identifiers, but all similar identifiers need to be grouped together. Records sharing the same identifier need to appear in chronological order.</p>
