The executable files for the two applications included in Scenario Tools 
(ScenarioManager.exe and ScenarioAnalyzer.exe) are provided in the Bin folder.  
To run the applications, the .exe files require a number of .dll files, which 
are in the same folder.  To function correctly, these two .exe and all .dll 
files must be kept together in the same folder.  The Scenario Manager and 
Scenario Analyzer can be started by using Windows Explorer to open the 
executable files, or a shortcut may be placed on the Windows desktop.

The Bin folder also contains executable files for MODFLOW-2005, ver. 1.10 
(mixed-precision and fully double precision versions) and for SEAWAT, ver. 4.

Tutorials for Scenario Manager and Scenario Analayzer are in the Doc folder.
