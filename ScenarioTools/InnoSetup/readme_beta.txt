This pre-release distribution of Scenario Tools is provided for beta testing.  It has not been approved for release outside the USGS.  

Example models have been installed under the user-selected installation folder in a folder named "ScenarioTools\examples".  Some model-output files need to be generated before Scenario Analyzer can be used with those models.  To generate those output files, after installation is completed, please copy the entire examples folder to a location on your computer where you have write privileges.  Then run the batch file PrepareExamples.bat in the examples folder.  This will cause one or more example models to run and generate the required output files.  PrepareExamples.bat may take several minutes to complete the model run(s).

Please provide bug reports or other suggestions for improvement to:
